## Exemplo Prático Dado por Dan Peña:

**Se um dos seus "wants" é aumentar seu patrimônio líquido em $5,000,000 todo mês, então você transforma isso em uma meta escrevendo na sua lista de metas:**

*"I want to increase my net worth by $5,000,000, or more each and every month."*

**A afirmação seria:**

*"I am happily and easily increasing the amount of my net worth by $5,000,000 or more each and every month."*

## Explicações de Dan Peña sobre cada elemento:

• **The phrase "I am" sends a command to your subconscious so that it can work on this goal for you, even while you are asleep.**

• **The terms "happily and easily" tell your subconscious that you will not struggle to accomplish this. You may want to use another term that will help you experience the emotions of the increased amounts in savings.**

• **The present tense word "increasing" creates a stress between what you are saying and reality so that your subconscious acts with a sense of urgency to make this happen.**

• **The "or more" is important also because when you realize how easy it is to increase your savings account by $5,000,0000 each month, you may want to immediately raise that amount. These two little words will have already sent the message to your subconscious and you will reach that monthly amount quicker.**

• **The best times to say the affirmations are in the morning when you get up and in the evening just before you go to bed. By saying them at night, you are commanding your subconscious to work on them while you sleep. By saying them in the morning, you give your subconscious the opportunity to present a "report" of what it did while you slept.**
